This is the website for the [UX Developer Intern & Web Developer Intern Challenge - Fall 2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SdR9rQpocsH5rPTOcxr9noqHRld5NJlylKO9Hf94U8U/edit#heading=h.31w9woubunro).

You can see it running here: https://letiste.github.io/ShopifyFrontendChallenge/

This website was made using [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).

You can search movies by title, nominate your 5 favorites movies and share it with a link. LocalStorage was used to save your list when you close the site.

If you wish to run it locally, you need to

- Clone the repository
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the development server: `npm run dev`

You can build the site with `npm run build` or serve a production-like server with `npm run serve`.
